Hi, my name is Alvaro Heitor, I like games and computer science, I know the basics but I intend to learn as much as I can, I'm starting on github to know more about the information area
I don't want to pursue a big career, I just want to learn about it and work with technology since it's something I really like and I think I would feel good working in this field
